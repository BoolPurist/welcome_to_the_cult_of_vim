## Why Vim Motions/Bindings/Mode

- Higher learning curve but also higher speed scaling in writing/navigating text.
  - No need for mouse. Moving right hand to mouse and back is slow.
  - No leaving home row. Moving hand away from home row is still slower.
  - Normal Mode gives you navigation speed unseen in the normal editor.
  - Visual Mode is faster way for selecting text.
  - Every keybinding can be remapped.
  - Can be more ergonomic for hands. Most bindings do not involve the ctrl hell like bindings other editors.
- Worthwhile editors for coding, Visual Studio Code, Rider, Visual Studio, etc ., 
have a plugin for vim bindings. There easy to set up.



### The moment where was not going back for me.

- So many clipboards via registers


## Why Vim as Editor

Not needed. But at least give Vim Motions a try.

- Highly cutomisable
- Highly extentible via Plugins
- You can make it a IDE to a degree you wish.

## Concepts in vim
